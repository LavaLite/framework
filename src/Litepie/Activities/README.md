# Log activity inside lavalite

The `litepie/activities` package provides easy to use functions to log the activities of the users of your app. It can also automatically log model events. 
The Package stores all activity in the `activity_log` table.

Here's a demo of how you can use it:

```php
activity()->log('Look, I logged something');
```

You can retrieve all activity using the `Litepie\Activities\Models\Activity` model.

```php
Activity::all();
```

Here's a more advanced example:
```php
activity()
   ->performedOn($anEloquentModel)
   ->causedBy($user)
   ->withProperties(['customProperty' => 'customValue'])
   ->log('Look, I logged something');

$lastLoggedActivity = Activity::all()->last();

$lastLoggedActivity->subject; //returns an instance of an eloquent model
$lastLoggedActivity->causer; //returns an instance of your user model
$lastLoggedActivity->getExtraProperty('customProperty'); //returns 'customValue'
$lastLoggedActivity->description; //returns 'Look, I logged something'
```


Here's an example on [event logging](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-activitylog/v2/advanced-usage/logging-model-events).

```php
$newsItem->name = 'updated name';
$newsItem->save();

//updating the newsItem will cause the logging of an activity
$activity = Activity::all()->last();

$activity->description; //returns 'updated'
$activity->subject; //returns the instance of NewsItem that was created
```

Calling `$activity->changes` will return this array:

```php
[
   'attributes' => [
        'name' => 'updated name',
        'text' => 'Lorum',
    ],
    'old' => [
        'name' => 'original name',
        'text' => 'Lorum',
    ],
];
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require litepie/activities
```

The package will automatically register itself.

You can publish the migration with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Litepie\Activities\ActivitylogServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

*Note*: The default migration assumes you are using integers for your model IDs. If you are using UUIDs, or some other format, adjust the format of the subject_id and causer_id fields in the published migration before continuing.

After publishing the migration you can create the `activity_log` table by running the migrations:


```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can optionally publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Litepie\Activities\ActivitylogServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /**
     * When set to false, activitylog will not 
     * save any activities to the database.
     */
    'enabled' => env('ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED', true),

    /**
     * Running the clean-command will delete all activities
     * older than the number of days specified here.
     */
    'delete_records_older_than_days' => 365,


    /**
     * When not specifying a log name when logging activity
     * we'll using this log name.
     */
    'default_log_name' => 'default',


    /**
     * When set to true, the subject returns soft deleted models.
     */
     'subject_returns_soft_deleted_models' => false,
     
     
    /**
     * The model used to log the activities. 
     * It should be or extend the Litepie\Activities\Models\Activity model.
     */
    'activity_model' => \Litepie\Activities\Models\Activity::class,
